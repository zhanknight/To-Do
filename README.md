# TO DO LIST

This is a standard to do list app using jQuery. It supports adding, completing, and deleting items. It also features a dark mode toggle. Although jQuery isn't used often in new projects these days, I wanted to write something using its most current version as an exercise. As it is, it isn't very useful - there's no data persistence!
